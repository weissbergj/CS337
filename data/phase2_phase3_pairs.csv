Endogenous binding of PD-1 with one of its two ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2 results in production of an inhibitory signal which results in reduction of T-cell proliferation, cytokine production, and cytotoxic activity. This results in significant dampening of the immune response. Nivolumab acts to selectively block the receptor activation of PD-L1 and PD-L2, resulting in a release of PD-1 mediated inhibition of the immune response., Ipilimumab is a fully humanized monoclonal anti-CTLA-4 antibody that acts as an antineoplastic ICI by selectively binding to cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4, a molecule located on the surface of cytotoxic T-cells, suppressing the immune response (17).

This is called a stem-cell transplant. As part of the transplant process, patients receive high doses of chemotherapy and/or radiation to treat their underlying disease, such as cancer. As one of its effects, this treatment also kills the healthy stem cells that are already in the marrow. The transplant provides new stem cells for the patient from a healthy donor; that replace the bone marrow and allow the blood counts to recover., Prior to transplantation, subjects will receive BUSULFAN via the central venous line, four times a day for four days (days -7 through -4)., Prior to stem cell transplantation, subjects will receive CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE via the central venous line once a day for two days on days -3 and -2., MELPHALAN will be given via the central venous line for one day, on day -1, prior to stem cell transplantation., G-CSF is to be given daily IV beginning on day +1 until ANC 2.5 x 109/L., ATG will be administered to umbilical cord blood recipients.",INTERVENTIONAL,"PHASE2, PHASE3",Probability of Long-term Disease-free Survival (DFS),"Neoplasms Hematologic Neoplasms Leukemia, Lymphoid Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma","PHASE2, PHASE3","stem cell transplant, busulfan, cyclophosphamide, melphalan, g-csf, atg",TERMINATED,0

Both normal and tumor cells metabolize 5-FU to 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine monophosphate (FdUMP) and 5-fluorouridine triphosphate (FUTP). These metabolites cause cell injury by two different mechanisms. First, FdUMP and the folate cofactor, N5-10-methylenetetrahydrofolate, bind to thymidylate synthase (TS) to form a covalently bound ternary complex. This binding inhibits the formation of thymidylate from 2'-deoxyuridylate. Thymidylate is the necessary precursor of thymidine triphosphate, which is essential for the synthesis of DNA, so that a deficiency of this compound can inhibit cell division. Second, nuclear transcriptional enzymes can mistakenly incorporate FUTP in place of uridine triphosphate (UTP) during the synthesis of RNA.

Ipilimumab is a CTLA-4 immune checkpoint inhibitor that blocks T-cell inhibitory signals induced by the CTLA-4 pathway, increasing the number of tumor reactive T effector cells which mobilize to mount a direct T-cell immune attack against tumor cells. CTLA-4 blockade can also reduce T regulatory cell function, which may lead to an increase in anti-tumor immune response., A fully human immunoglobulin (Ig) G4 monoclonal antibody directed against the negative immunoregulatory human cell surface receptor programmed cell death-1 (PD-1,PCD-1) with immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. Nivolumab binds to and blocks the activation of PD-1, an Ig superfamily transmembrane protein, by its ligands programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), overexpressed on certain cancer cells, and programmed cell death ligand 2 (PD-L2), which is primarily expressed on APCs (antigen presenting cells). This results in the activation of T-cells and cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells or pathogens. Activated PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell activation and and plays a key role in in tumor evasion from host immunity.",INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE2,Confirm the clinical efficacy of ipi/nivo in rare cancer histotypes which have demonstrated to be responsive to the regimen in the CA209-538 study.
